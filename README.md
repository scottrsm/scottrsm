# Scott McIntire's Profile

## I Have an Eclectic Collection of Programming Projects
Most recently, I am working on projects using the language **Julia** (repo julia) as project work is, I believe,
necessary to gain an understanding of a given language.

## I Have an Interest in Mathematics Education
- Repo: math.
- There is a non-standard calculus book which compares and contrasts discrete and continuous calculus.
- Several papers describing mathematical concepts that are traditionally poorly explained.
- A few new results.
- Some alternative proofs of elementary facts along with some conjectures based on programming experiments.

## Background
I have worked in the Finance industry as a *quant* most recently, but I have also worked in Academia and in the Tech industry.
